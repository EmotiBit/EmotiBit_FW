### Dependencies
- From the Arduino Library manager get the latest version of [Adafruit_NeoPixel Library](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_NeoPixel)
  - There are multiple libraries with similar names; _Adafruit NeoPixel_ is proper
  - This example was created using v1.2.3
- May want to consider a migration to Adafruit NeoMatrix, which is compatible with GFX library
